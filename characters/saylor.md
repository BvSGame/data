# 📄 Saylor

💣 ***[Bombs vs. Sleepwalkers](/README.md)** ➔ [Characters](/characters/readme.md)*

- ***Written:** February 28 - March 1, 2025.*
- ***Revised:** March 1, 2025.*
- ***Status:** not final! Subject to change, open to suggestions.*

## 1. Physicality

- **Gender:** female (she/her).
- **Age:** 20 (as of early 2024; birthday is August 30, 2003).
- **Height:** 5’9” (175 cm).
- **Weight:** 138 lb (62.5 kg) – inaccuracies are not critical.
- **Body shape measurements:** 33-25-32 (84-64-81) – inaccuracies are not critical.
- **Hair:** short (shoulder-length beachy waves / wavy bob), pink color, partially tinted with blue-violet.
  - As a teenager, she had long, straight, brown-colored hair.
- **Eye color:** blue.

## 2. In-game and key story/lore aspects

- **Student of the tech university**. Regularly gets top grades. She was an excellent student at school and even participated in the Science Olympiad.
- **Time traveler**, mostly involuntarily.
- She’s **quite popular in her contemporary period**. However, she tries to **remain unrecognizable while time-traveling** (to leave fewer traces in history) by choosing different names, wearing wigs, etc.
- She has **no birth mother** and she doesn’t even remember her (there was a divorce during Saylor’s very early childhood). She lived with her **stepmother** until she (Saylor) moved out. Saylor saw her stepmother as more of a **closest friend** than a surrogate mother, and addressed her by name, never calling her mom.
- Together with her childhood friend Rick, she **videoblogs** mostly about building robots. She **monetizes it**, and from this she **finances everything**, including her education.

## 3. Attire and accessories

### 3-1. Common elements

- In her outfits, Saylor is most comfortable sticking to the concept of **“female masculinity”** – she prefers to choose clothing that reads as masculine but only fits women. She embraces unisex/androgynous clothing as well.
- **Handbag**. Big enough (but not oversized) to carry tablet (see [below](#7-gadgets-and-devices)) and some tools. Stylish in a way.
  - Not to be confused with **purse** – see [preneLOVE blog post](https://prenelove.ca/blogs/news/handbag-vs-purse), [Latico Leathers blog post](https://laticoleathers.com/en-gb/blogs/news/purses-vs-handbags) and [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handbag). Purse is a confusing word that is primarily associated with a small bag that is larger than a wallet. Handbag is less ambiguous, despite being used chiefly in United Kingdom and Europe.
- It’s not rare that she wears **fingerless gloves**. Color could vary.
- A **simple necklace** and some **bracelets**.
- **Earrings** – no specifics.

### 3-2. Standard/contemporary outfit

- **Blue denim overall dress**. Constant and most iconic attribute that makes her stand out.
- Any **T-shirt/top** – no specifics (changed regularly). In rare occasions, she wears **button-down shirts**.
- **Sticky patches** that could be easily detached and replaced. No specifics, but at least one patch is **heart-shaped**. She has a whole **little box** full of various sticky patches.

### 3-3. While time-traveling

- **Wigs** can have absolutely any color and hairstyle.

### 3-4. Special notes

- She prefers **pants** or **jeans** if overall dress is not suitable. Combined with **colored checkered shirt** (the addition of **top** is allowed), it’s a perfect match for her.
- She considers **skirts** and **stockings** uncomfortable.
- She dislikes **heels**.
- Not a fan of **proper dresses**, but she could make exceptions, particularly during **the Industrial Revolution** and **medieval times**.

## 4. Skills

- Masterful and passionate **tech enthusiast**. Particularly in **robotics**.
- **Mathematician**. She does some calculations fairly quickly.
- She is capable of **playing piano and guitar**. More or less.
- Father and stepmother insisted Saylor take vocal lessons as a teenager, hoping to make her a future singer. Saylor was against it, in addition to being constantly told that singing was not for her. However, she does have some **vocal ability**.
- **Speaks English fluently**. Also, she used to be **a fan of French**.

## 5. Personality

- **Extroverted**. Not only does she **meet new people almost seamlessly**, but she **inspires the less socialized**.
- **Sarcastic**. Very.
- She’s no stranger to **witty humor**. Not afraid to **act foolish** – it makes her charming at times.
- **Very curious** about anything. Eager to learn, explore and investigate.
- **Quickly adapts to the unexpected**. **Comprehends new information with ease**.
- She’s usually **hesitant to admit her mistakes**. But she **avoids shifting responsibility to others**.
- **Emotionally open**, but **crying very rarely**.
- **Critical of her past**.
- **She rarely adheres to her age**. She’s often being **childish** (to give someone a **false sense of security**), but there are times when she’s **uncharacteristically wise**.

## 6. Catchphrases and mannerisms

- **“Stellar”** – versatile word used at the moments of surprise, delight, sudden realization (eureka), positive expectations, annoyance, disappointment or rejection when someone tries to cheer her up.
- **“Don’t thank me for small/insignificant things”** – she dislikes being thanked for something other than her own efforts or accomplishments.
- She’s **obsessed with the flavor of bubble gum**. If there’s a gum-flavored soda, there’s no stopping her.
- She often **utters phrases in a melodic, humming tone**.
- She regularly throws in **references to popular media**. She never gets hung up on certain franchises, always discovering something to enjoy.
- **“But I’m just Saylor”** *(or any other name she goes by)* – used to point out that she’s not as important as someone makes her out to be.
- She has a **passion for pizza**. She’s an **outspoken hater of pineapple pizza**.

## 7. Gadgets and devices

- **Tablet** (13’, not iPad) – primary device for everything. She’s carrying it in her handbag anywhere and anytime if possible. Bundled with a stylus pen. Saylor uses her tablet to **analyze surroundings** and **control other devices**.
- **Smartwatch** (not Apple Watch).
- She loves **gaming consoles**. Especially portable ones.
- She’s not a fan of **smartphones and mobile phones**.
