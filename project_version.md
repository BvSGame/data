## WIP 2.0

- Not started yet.

## WIP 1.5

### February 2025

#### 20

- `0.1.5.1`
  - Proper versioning of the project itself is started! Introducing “project_version” files! Publicly accessible from: <https://bvsgame.github.io/data/project_version.md>
    - From now on, all other elements of the project are sharing this number.
    - If contributions are done simultaneously by multiple people, it’s recommended to use the format of branches, e.g. `0.1.5.1_edx`
      - Branch names must be unique. Simply use a short form of your nickname, like `edx` is short for `liledix4`
      - Eventually, all branches must be merged into the main version number.
  - Public to-do list is started: <https://bvsgame.github.io/data/2do.md>
