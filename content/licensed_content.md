## How IDs work

7-digit hexadecimal number. If itâ€™s 8-digit, it has leading zero *(unless you consider going beyond 21st century â€“ time traveler as well, huh?)*

```text
7-digit  â”‚  8-digit
         â”‚
2530500  â”‚  02530500
â€”â€”_â€”â€”__  â”‚  â€”â€”â€”_â€”â€”__
1 23 4   â”‚  1  23 4
```

1. `25` â€“ last two digits of the year (2025).
    - Or last three digits, if itâ€™s about `025`.
2. `3` â€“ month (March). `a` for October, `b` for November, `c` for December.
3. `05` â€“ day (5th). Thereâ€™s also an extended format, see below.
4. `00` â€“ serial number. Every day, it starts with `00` and ends with `ff`, meaning that this number can hold up to 256 IDs per day.
    - However, if 256 is not enough for some reason, add 40 to the day part â€“ `45`, `85` and `c5` all mean the 5th day, just extended. This way, up to 1024 IDs per day are allowed.

### Where IDs are used

Anywhere thereâ€™s a need to avoid lengthy references (like file names, directory paths and URLs). Especially when it comes to the programmatic fetching.
