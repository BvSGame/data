## 21 February 2025

### 0.1.5.4

- **Scripts (Private)** are properly uploaded! ALL of them!

## 20 February 2025

### 0.1.5.3

- **Data Converter** – early version is done: <https://bvsgame.github.io/data/converter>. It just converts “project_version.md” to JSON format.
  - *Outdated, see [breaking change in 0.1.5.5](/project_versions/wip1_5/2025_03.md#0155).*

### 0.1.5.2

- **Data**
  - Empty files for Markdown converter are created.
  - Instead of just JSON files, it’s also planned to have conversions to CSV and XML files.
  - **2do.md** – now formatted as a Markdown checklist.

### 0.1.5.1

- Proper versioning of the project itself is started! Introducing “project_version” files! Publicly accessible from: <https://bvsgame.github.io/data/project_version.md>
  - From now on, all other elements of the project are sharing this number.
  - If contributions are done simultaneously by multiple people, it’s recommended to use the format of branches, e.g. `0.1.5.1_edx`
    - Branch names must be unique. Simply use a short form of your nickname, like `edx` is short for `liledix4`
    - Eventually, all branches must be merged into the main version number.
- Public to-do list is started: <https://bvsgame.github.io/data/2do.md>
