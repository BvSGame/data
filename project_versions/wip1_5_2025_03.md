### 0.1.5.8

  - Massively revamped [main ReadMe page](/README.md)!!!!
  - EVERY Markdown file (old and new) in this repository got following updates:
    - The returning practice of adding navigational links right below H1 headings!
    - The returning practice of adding emojis at the beginning of H1 headings to visually differentiate categories (ReadMe files) and pages! (all other Markdown files)
    - Front matter got `contributors_*` properties, separate for each development stage.
    - `revised` property in the front matter, contains version number during which the revision is occured.
    - Serialized pages, like [BvS 1 story chapters](/story/bvs1/readme.md), have additional ‚ÄúPrevious/Next‚Äù navigation elements.
  - New info:
    - [Document for Artists](/design_art/document_for_artists.md) ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt have images, but text is exactly the same as in the privately shared PDF file.
  - New directories:
    - `characters/mini_bosses/`
    - `characters/sleepwalkers/`
    - `coding_dev/languages/`
    - `coding_dev/tenacious_dreamforge/`
    - `collaboration/`
    - `gameplay/devices_gadgets/`
    - `gameplay/items/`
    - `gameplay/levels/`
    - `gameplay/vehicles/`
    - `gameplay/weapons/`
    - `help/`
  - Replacements and rearrangements:
    - `index.json` file moved from the root directory to `json/`. It‚Äôs planned to additionally have CSV and XML versions later on.
    - Directory `coding_dev/game_engines/` is replaced with [Game Engines](/coding_dev/game_engines.md) page.
    - Replaced `distribution/github/` and `distribution/steam/` ‚Äì with `distribution/services/` that now contains [GitHub](/distribution/services/github.md) and [Steam](/distribution/services/steam.md) pages.
    - Renamed `project_version/` to `project_versions/` and deleted all subdirectories ‚Äì instead, there are files directly in one common place: [Legacy](/project_versions/legacy.md), [WIP 1.0](/project_versions/wip1_0.md), [WIP 1.5: February 2025](/project_versions/wip1_5_2025_02.md), [WIP 1.5: March 2025](/project_versions/wip1_5_2025_03.md) and [WIP 2.0](/project_versions/wip2_0.md).
    - Deleted `story/chapters/` directory. Instead, there are subdirectories for every game that contain pages for story chapters and side stories:
      - `story/bvs1/`
      - `story/bvs1/side_stories/`
      - `story/bvs2/`
      - `story/bvso/` ‚Äì with a number of new subdirectories: `darkrock_story/`, `saylor_story` and `toni_story`.
      - `story/bvs3d/`

- **Discord server**
  - **WIP 2** category is renamed to **WIP 2 / WIP 1.5**
  - A number of new private channels for **WIP 2 / WIP 1.5** category ‚Äì they‚Äôre replicating the file structure of `data` and `private` Git repositories (with a few exceptions that are considered unneeded for Discord).
  - Now there‚Äôs the returning practice of writing story drafts and fresh ideas **directly** to the Discord server channels ‚Äì once they‚Äôre fleshed out, they‚Äôre being committed to Git repositories.

## 1 March 2025

### 0.1.5.7

- **Data**
  - Slight edit of `characters/saylor.md`

### 0.1.5.6

- **Data**
  - Small but important changes to `characters/saylor.md` to reduce the ambiguity and improve readability. And a few new lines were added.

### 0.1.5.5

- **Data**
  - BIGGEST UPDATE: introducing freshly written `characters/saylor.md` ‚Äì 960 words of introduction, adapted specifically for artists.
  - Now both PUBLIC and PRIVATE data repositories share the same file structure!
    - Starting from this version, some parts of information are becoming more transparent.
  - Unnecessary `.gitkeep` files are deleted.
  - Instead of `story_chapters` directory, there‚Äôs a `story` directory with `chapters` subdirectory.
  - Instead of multiple `index.json` files (one for each directory), there‚Äôs just one `index.json` file at the root directory.
  - Instead of a single `project_version.md` file, there‚Äôs a `project_versions` directory, and WIP directories may have various Markdown files named as a year and month.
    - Text structure for change logs is also changed. Version numbers are headings now. And there are full dates instead of simply days.
  - For Markdown files, there are several new practices introduced:
    - Front matter.
      - `revised` ‚Äì version number during which the Markdown file is revised (checked if the changes are necessary).
    - Highlighting ideas.
      - Using `==this Markdown syntax==`, now it‚Äôs possible to highlight ideas so that they could be added to the list of ideas (parser would treat highlights in a special way). There‚Äôs no need to have separate files for collecting ideas and takes any longer ‚Äì now there‚Äôs a direct integration with Markdown files.
    - Footnotes.
      - Footnotes are used to mention ideas/opinions that are not supposed to be a part of the main text.
  - Numerous empty files were created. Content will be added in the next versions.
  - Some housekeeping.
