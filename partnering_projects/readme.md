# üìÅ Partnering Projects

üí£ ***[Bombs vs. Sleepwalkers][home]***

## List of partnering projects

- [Doki Doki Literature Club! New Heading][ddlcnh] ‚Äì project that introduced [Lisa][char_lisa] as a character. This character is the linking element of DDLC:NH and BvS.

## What it means to be a partnering project (and how to become one)

Partnership is either about exchange or acknowledgement. Exchange could be: cameos of the characters, special artwork, specially composed or remixed music, crossover/collab scripts and stories, collaborative media events.

There are a number of criteria by which a project is determined eligible for partnership. The project must comply with at least one of the following:

- Its concepts should be relatively mature.
- Be recognized among some significant groups of people. If the project is on the lips of at least 100 people roughly, it's already great.
- Have relatively promising production quality. You don't have to do something mindblowing, just do something nice and pretty.
- If any director is impressed with certain aspects not mentioned in this list, that matters too.
