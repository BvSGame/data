# üìÑ AI

üí£ ***[Bombs vs. Sleepwalkers][home]***

## We‚Äôre strongly against generative AI

The project *Bombs vs. Sleepwalkers* strives against the use of generative AI in any share and form. We fully encourage human creative effort. We try to produce every detail of the project in a way that we can thoroughly explain it in our own words.

The first rule for every valuable *BvS* contributor: **don‚Äôt let laziness make you resort to solutions where your own ideas start to lose significance!**

Particularly, the following are strictly prohibited:

- **Image generation** (Stable Diffusion, Dall-E)
- **Music generation** (Suno)
- **Text and code generation** (ChatGPT, DeepL Write, GitHub Copilot, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot)
- **Video generation** (Sora)

Exceptions:

- **DeepL Translator** (not to be confused with DeepL Write!) ‚Äì you‚Äôre allowed to use it to correct grammatical errors and translate text more efficiently. In the end, given that today every company is implementing AI in ultimately everything, it‚Äôs impossible to completely avoid it ‚Äì so we only exclude areas that directly affect human creativity.

## Consequences in case you use generative AI

In the event that you resort to using generative AI in the content production, you give us reason to doubt your competence in the activities we have entrusted to you. Consequently, we may consider restricting your future contribution to the project and removing contributed content that may have potentially or actually been influenced by generative AI.

## Earlier uses of AI in the project

There have been mistakes in the past that must be acknowledged so as not to repeat them again.

During [WIP 1.0][wip10] and early [WIP 1.5][wip15] (until August 2024 when the practice is put to an end), 346 images were generated from textual notes we wrote completely on our own. Previously, the rules made it clear that everything AI-generated is only suitable as concepts (it can‚Äôt be used in any way in final production, and nobody can draw new ideas from it) so that actual artists would understand our ideas more clearly when drawing various parts from scratch ‚Äì and now we realize that those restrictions weren‚Äôt enough.

We don‚Äôt publish those images anywhere because we realize how insulting it is for artists and creative communities, and we try to minimize harm.

## AI training based on our content

To our great regret, we have no means of counteracting AI training. We can‚Äôt protect media content, textual content, and code from having AI databases trained on them. The licenses we choose to freely distribute our content do not protect against such unfair uses. So, AI training will continue to happen, despite our open protest and no matter how much we demand compliance with the license rules we apply to our content.

## ‚ÄúGuys, you‚Äôre not doing anything that the AI can accomplish much better and faster anyway! Why do you care so much?‚Äù

It‚Äôs not about who/what makes it better quality-wise. It‚Äôs about the human experience communicated through creative work.

If you don‚Äôt share such views, that‚Äôs your right, but if you expect us to rethink and change our approaches, your position should be reasoned enough for that.

Call it stubbornness, but to be fair, it‚Äôs not unreasonable.
