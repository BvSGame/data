# üìÑ F.A.Q. (Frequently Asked Questions)

üí£ ***[Bombs vs. Sleepwalkers][home]***

Or not necessarily ‚Äúfrequently asked‚Äù (just a fancy title) but simply ‚Äúexpected‚Äù questions we already have answers for!

## Is there anything playable? Any demos?

No. As of March 2025, we barely have any playable demos. Until WIP 3, we‚Äôre not focusing too much on the development of the game itself ‚Äì first of all, most important concepts must be worked out.

## Do you expect this project to succeed?

No. There‚Äôs no problem at all if this project flops or keeps flopping. If any of our contributors expect it to succeed, it would be reasonable for them to put their maximum effort (it‚Äôs just how it works ‚Äì you can‚Äôt expect fire to happen if you won‚Äôt try to make it).

Other than that, this is an open-source project. It is designed to be continuously maintained if there‚Äôs any interest involved.

## Are games going to be free?

Absolutely! It‚Äôs open-source, after all. Everything officially released will be available for free, with one fair exception. Some special additional elements like DLCs and mods could be released on distribution platforms like Steam as paid packages, in case if you‚Äôd like to support the project financially.

## Does this project have a budget?

It‚Äôs tiny, less than $1,000 (eventual increase to $5,000 is planned).

Contributors may invest in the project from their salaries or donations/income received from their other projects. Obviously, we don‚Äôt have big-budget investors (and being an open-source project, it‚Äôs problematic to have them).

Donations are welcome and we‚Äôre considering crowdfunding.

## Don‚Äôt you find ‚Äúbombing‚Äù as a key theme of the game disturbing?

Bombing is extremely common in mainstream media and should not be questioned unless the whole story itself is morally controversial.

In the storytelling, we try to stick to the least controversy possible, and we try to play up imminent or intentional controversies as a criticism of them. It‚Äôs important to realize that the plot involves the destruction of inanimate objects (robots) ‚Äì interpreting this in any way as the destruction of anything organic (especially humans and animals) is the viewer‚Äôs projection of their own experiences and views, for which we‚Äôre not responsible.

In a way, such misinterpretation should be even concerning, it could be a sign of PTSD or perceived severe shocks in the past ‚Äì if that‚Äôs the case, consider getting professional psychotherapeutic help.

## What is the maturity rating for your media?

We strictly recommend an age limit of 12 years and above. We actively touch on topics that are not easy to understand without an adult explanation.

## You‚Äôre doing/planning too much

This is a passion project. It‚Äôs not supposed to be small.

Besides:

1. For some contributors, it‚Äôs a showcase of what they‚Äôre capable of, they can present their work to the public to find jobs or attract customers.
2. Just because so much is planned doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre going to do absolutely everything ourselves. We do outlines for those people who plan to keep the project evolving in the future.

## Do you use AI in your work?

See [AI][ai].

## What is the estimated release date?

If enough people participate in the project, relatively proper game release is scheduled for 2027-2028.

## Can I join the project and contribute to it?

From time to time, applications open up. This only happens when we have enough new content to attract people ‚Äì and we announce that throughout our blogs and social media and even beyond.

## Will the games be updatable?

Yes. By the nature of the project, every detail including the games themselves is being updated, changed, remastered or redefined. However, we respect that not everyone would be willing to get regular updates, therefore we would take care of LTS versions (Long-Term Support).

## Am I allowed to modify the games?

Absolutely yes! In addition to the modding features we provide for the games without changing the original files (and scripting language Scriptwalk that makes the process easier), the game repositories can be forked and edited in any way you wish. However, keep in mind that you need to comply with AGPL license if you‚Äôre planning any kind of distribution.

## Your game is not compliant for distribution because of AGPL license

Contact us for getting a version of the game with more suitable license.

## Is this a hobby project?

Yes and no. There are important nuances.

From the perspective of individual contributors, it depends. For them, this project may be: a casual hobby to pass the time, a creative practice, a portfolio item, or a thing they expect a career growth from. We cover all of these.

In case of the project itself, how it‚Äôs been started and what its purpose is: we strive to create a project that is able to realize many of our ideas and concepts in some unified form.

## What about ads and MTX? (microtransactions)

None! We‚Äôre strongly against those!

## The title sounds ridiculous

It‚Äôs been like that since the early 2010s and it stays unchanged to honor the legacy. In fact, it‚Äôs intentionally ridiculous enough to prevent people from getting their own ideas about the premise. It‚Äôs all about the story, not the title.

## Do you really take all this nonsense seriously?

All criticism is welcome, but only if it‚Äôs reasoned, substantiated, and purged of bias. It all depends more on the position with which you present it than on how we take it into account.

For example, if you present a critique with the position ‚Äúthe project should be canceled,‚Äù the critique loses value because it‚Äôs not in the best interest of the project.
