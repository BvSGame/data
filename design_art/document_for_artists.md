## 1. Saylor

Tech student girl from 2024. 20-21 years old.

Over the course of the narrative, she becomes a time traveler, trying to adapt to time periods by wearing wigs and changing clothes.

She always carries a tablet computer with her, to analyze surroundings and control devices.

### 1-1. Hairstyles

Shoulder-length beachy waves / wavy bob.

Normally, the color is pink, partially tinted with blue-violet. Wigs can have absolutely any color and style.

#### 1-1-1. Specific to time periods

These could be wigs or actual hair could be stylized.

#### 1-1-2. Sources

### 1-2. Clothes and accessories

Denim overall dress, sticky patches, handbag.

#### 1-2-1. Denim overall dress

#### 1-2-2. Sticky patches

Design of sticky patches is not specific. Imagine them attached to the denim overall dress.

Design is not specific here (subject to change). Should be big enough to carry tablet PC.

### 1-3. Gadget -- Tablet PC

This is NOT iPad! Also, the operating system is more advanced than
Android (therefore, it should be Linux-powered).
